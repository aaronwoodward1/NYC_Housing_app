# Streeteasy Sales and Rental Dashboard

The Streeteasy Sales and Rental Dashboard is a web application designed to present data metrics focused on the New York City housing market. The dashboard uses monthly summary metrics from the Zillow's StreetEasy website and present those metrics through interactive visualizations using leaflet and plotly. The application has two tabs separately presenting sales and rental data.

A special thanks to Siyuan Li (https://github.com/siyuanligit) who developed a similiar web application using StreetEasy data (https://siyuanli.shinyapps.io/REexplorer/), which was a immense help in providing guidance on cleansing the raw data.
